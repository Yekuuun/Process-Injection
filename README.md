# Process-Injection ðŸ‘º

<strong>This repo contains different well known basic methods used for process injections on Windows. I created this repository due to my interest for c programming using WinApi and understanding the intern mecanisms of those techniques by implementing some of them.</strong>

---


## What I've Implemented :

ðŸŸ¢ **ShellExec** -> `/ShellExec`

ðŸŸ¢ **NTShellExec** -> `/NTShellExec` (using NTAPI functions)

ðŸŸ¢ **DLL injection** -> `/DLL`

## Disclaimer ðŸš¨

This project is developped for learning purpose and I'm not responsible of your acts if you decide to use them.

## Notes

I didn't implement a folder using NT functions for DLL injection cause if you want, you can simply use code from NTShellExec who show you how to use them and apply the same logic into a DLL injection method.
